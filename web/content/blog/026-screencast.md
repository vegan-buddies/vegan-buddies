In this stream I discover that ther was [some sort of problem](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/1061) with the room joining code and everything has been reverted. Maybe that's why room joining doesn't work. I won't find out untill one of the core devs gives me more context. In any case, the bot tester bot is still not working.
