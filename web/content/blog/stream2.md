In this stream I worked on trying to run fluffychat in the Android emulator but was unable to launch the emulator. If anyone can help me that would be great!

Also, I started working on a new matrix bot written in rust, that will be
 - able to query users by location
 - record and store user ratings
 - record other user attributes
 - record user "qualifications" in the form of their filling out questionares
