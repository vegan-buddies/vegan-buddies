I need to use the `create_dm_room` function from the rust matrix SDK. However, unfortunately this function is not public. I created [a PR](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/961) to change that fact, but still need to address the concerns of the mainatainers. In this stream I try to address their concerns.
