Give us a sense of who you are
-------------------------------------

Hi, I'm Tim. First off, I'm not applying alone.

The Veganbuddies project is under Otevři Oči z.s. ( otevrioci.cz ), a Czech abolitionist vegan non profit with a 13 year history in the Czech Republic. Otevři oči has organized countless events such as Veggie parade ( we had over a thousand participants at our pre-COVID peek ), the Official Animal Rights March Prague, World Farm Animals day, the information portal soucitne.cz and many many other events, vegan dinners, tasting sessions for the public, audio visual presentations on public squares ect.

The VeganBuddies app was conceived by Tereza Vandrovcová ( vandrovcova.cz/en ) who is among the best known Vegan activists in the country and is a founding member of Otevři Oči.

Back office is done by her husband, Silvester, who also has over a decade of activism experience under his belt.

UX design is done by Petr Beneš ( petben.cz ), another powerhouse of Czech animal rights activism. Besides countless 'smaller' projects such as the Christmas without Violence ( https://vanocebeznasili.cz/ ) PR campaign, Bilé Minus (White Minus - anti milk) ( https://bileminus.cz/ ), Konec Vajec ( End of eggs - https://konecvajec.cz/ ). Petr recently helped direct, cut, and do post production and promotion for the first feature length documentary on Czech animal agriculture to ever be screened in real theaters. You can watch it online here: https://sledujsvedectvi.cz/ ( I helped edit the English subtitles ).

Programming is done by me. Timothy Hobbs ( hobbs.cz ) . I was born in the USA, but I've lived in the Czech republic my whole adult life. In terms of activism, I actually started out focusing on Free Opensource Software (when that was still a thing done by volunteer activists and not major corporations like Microsoft). My first foray into Vegan activism beyond attending various rallies was when I cooked dumpster dived Vegan food at a local squat. Beyond that, I have engaged in direct outreach at events hosted by Anonymous for Voiceless and done translation work for Otevři Oči, translating the https://vanocebeznasili.cz/ website to English and helping edit the English subtitles of the feature length documentary Svědectví. Finally, I've already started developing the app. All the coding is done live. You can view previous sessions on our blog at https://veganbuddies.org/blog/
