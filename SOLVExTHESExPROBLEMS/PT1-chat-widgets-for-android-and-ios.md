PT1 - The ability to integrate chat into a mobile app for both iOS and Android
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Keywords: iOS, Android, Chat, matrix.org, XMPP

I need a set of free open source widgets that allow me to integrate a chat interface to matrix.org or XMPP procols.

It seems that nothing that works cross platform exists for XMPP so matrix it is.

Needs:

 - Support images
 - Support audio messages
 - E2EE would be nice to have
 - Must be easy to integrate
 - License can't be proprietary

1. https://www.dittochat.org/ - Beta

2. https://fluffychat.im/ - Personal experience says it's not %100 stable

3. https://syphon.org/ - Alpha
